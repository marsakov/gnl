We consider that get_next_line has an undefined behavior if, between two calls,
the same file descriptor designs two distinct files although the reading from the first
file was not completed.
We consider also that a call to lseek(2) will never take place between two calls of
the function get_next_line on the same file descriptor.
Finally we consider that get_next_line has an undefined behavior when reading
from a binary file. However, if you wish, you can make this behavior coherent.
